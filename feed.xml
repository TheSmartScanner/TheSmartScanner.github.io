<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.thesmartscanner.com/blog/14-software-security-terms-you-should-know">software security</a> and development, gray box testing has become an important but also laborious part of the process. This strategy, that is testing software functions based on partial knowledge of its internal workings, strikes a balance between the comprehensiveness of white-box testing (full internal knowledge) and the practicality of black-box testing (no internal knowledge). The beginning of machine learning (ML) brings opportunities to automate gray box testing, thus revolutionizing the software development lifecycle.</p>

<h2 id="the-role-of-machine-learning-in-automating-gray-box-testing">The Role of Machine Learning in Automating Gray Box Testing</h2>
<p>Machine learning algorithms can parse tons of code, test data, and logs from execution. As a result, they can identify patterns automatically, anticipate potential troubles ahead-and ultimately help out with writing new test cases layered on top of old ones. This is particularly useful in grey box testing, where testers have some understanding of the system’s architecture but lack intricate details of every component.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-automating-gray-box-testing-with-machine-learning">Benefits of Automating Gray Box Testing with Machine Learning</h2>

<h3 id="improved-efficiency-and-speed">Improved Efficiency and Speed </h3>
<p>By automating routine test execution tasks, human testers can spend more of their time on important tasks like test design, analysis, or edge-case exploration. According to research from <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/theautomationadvantage.pdf">Capgemini</a>, automation can cut up to 70% off of the time taken for testing execution which in turn accelerates development speed greatly.</p>

<h3 id="better-accuracy-and-more-reliability">Better Accuracy and More Reliability</h3>
<p>Machine learning algorithms are continuously learning and improving, over time, thus producing more accurate generations of test cases. This improvement in accuracy and reliability helps to shore up the testing</p>

<h3 id="reduced-potential-for-human-error">Reduced Potential for Human Error</h3>
<p>When repetitive tasks are automated, there is less likelihood of human error than when the same task has to be performed manually. Hence, test results also become more consistent and reliable.</p>

<h3 id="early-and-frequent-bug-detection">Early and Frequent Bug Detection</h3>
<p>You can auto detect bugs at an earlier stage and more frequently than ever before. Machine learning makes it possible to detect errors during program development. Detecting errors at this stage means that remedial programming can be done faster, and so reduces the cost of remedying defects later in the process.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-in-automating-gray-box-testing-with-machine-learning">Challenges in Automating Gray Box Testing with Machine Learning</h2>

<h3 id="high-initial-investment">High Initial Investment </h3>
<p>To implement a robust testing framework using machine learning, the upfront costs include automation instruments and learning materials -and possibly more personnel who are familiar with testing software as well as machine learning.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-expertise">Lack of expertise</h3>
<p>There is an increased need for people who can effectively implement automation testing and machine learning. This shortage of talent will become an obstacle to businesses implementing these techniques in practice.</p>

<h3 id="maintenance-complexity">Maintenance Complexity</h3>
<p>Maintaining the automation testing tools and machine learning models can be challenging. The work is never done due to the need to maintain models up-to-date with active code changes and continuously measure and improve test generations.</p>

<h3 id="execution-challenges">Execution Challenges</h3>
<p>Execution of automated tests is complex due to intricate lab management with every feature up-to-date and regular maintenance. Additionally, the lack of experience in automation testing platforms can also hinder test executions.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure-considerations">Infrastructure Considerations</h3>
<p>Organizations might not have the required testing infrastructure, such as automated testing tools and cloud-based lab solutions, to efficiently utilize machine learning for gray-box testing.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-the-right-framework">Choosing the Right Framework</h3>
<p>It can be difficult to pick the most suitable automation testing framework for your needs. Project scope, team expertise, and budget all influence this decision.</p>

<h2 id="case-studies-and-statistics-related-to-gray-box-testing-automation">Case Studies and Statistics related to Gray Box Testing Automation</h2>

<h3 id="1-engine-fault-diagnosis-study-by-daniel-jung">1. Engine Fault Diagnosis Study by Daniel Jung</h3>
<p>A research by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.04644.pdf">Daniel Jung</a> employed a physically-driven grey-box recurrent neural network for engine fault diagnosis. An internal combustion engine test bench data was used in the study and it was used to explain benefits of employing machine learning and model-based fault diagnosis methods together.</p>

<p>The study established that the physically-based grey-box recurrent neural network model was able to correctly diagnose problem in an internal combustion engine. The model was able to detect and isolate faults, even with the presence of measurement noise and process disturbances.</p>

<p>This research demonstrated the feasibility of integrating the two approaches: machine learning and model-based fault diagnosis. This is similar to gray box testing where both black-box (machine learning) and white-box (model-based) techniques are employed.</p>

<h3 id="2-two-stage-grey-box-modeling-approach-study">2. Two-Stage Grey-Box Modeling Approach Study</h3>
<p>Another case study delved into a <a href="https://www.sciencegate.app/document/10.1115/detc2017-67794">two-stage grey-box modeling approach</a> that combines knowledge-based (white-box) models with statistical (black-box) metamodels to achieve model reusability and improved predictions. The approach was used to develop a powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process.</p>

<p>The study demonstrated that the two-stage grey-box modeling method was more effective than the conventional approaches in terms of the predictability and the reusability. With the approach, the predicted process outcomes were found to be very accurate. This suggests that integrating manufacturing knowledge-based models alongside statistical metamodels improves the efficacy and precision of predictive modeling in manufacturing processes.</p>

<p>Similarly in gray box testing, predictability means to predict the results of a test based on the input, and reusability means to utilize the same test cases in different scenarios. Machine learning can do both of this parts.</p>

<h3 id="3-reinforcement-learning-based-monkey-agents">3. Reinforcement Learning-Based Monkey Agents</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-44355-8_1">conference paper</a> “Automation of User Interface Testing by Reinforcement Learning-Based Monkey Agents” the researcher had shown how to conduct grey-box GUI testing using reinforcement learning-algorithms can be implemented in practice to improve efficiency.</p>

<p>This research paper discussed how using reinforcement learning (a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative profit) for autonomous grey-box monkey testing can potentially give rise to advantages in terms of efficiency. </p>

<p>To explain in layman terms, they utilized a machine learning technique to automate the test process, making it faster and more productive.</p>

<h3 id="4-ai-based-test-automation-analysis">4. AI-based Test Automation Analysis </h3>
<p>The <a href="https://tsigalko18.github.io/assets/pdf/2021-Ricca-ICSTW.pdf">AI-based Test Automation analysis</a> grouped the 307 individual occurrences in four different major parts: test generation (41%), test oracle (12%), debugging (20%), and test maintenance (26%). The most popular ones (20% all in all) represent automated test generation.</p>

<p>Therefore, out of 307 examples examined, they have found that AI is used to generate test (41% of the time). These charts were also used for validating the results of tests (12%), debugging which would help in finding errors (20%), maintaining and upgrading tests (26%). The most frequent particular solution was the automated test generation that included 20% of all the solutions.</p>

<h2 id="applications-of-machine-learning-in-gray-box-testing-automation">Applications of Machine Learning in Gray Box Testing Automation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Automating Unit, Integration, and Performance Testing: Unit tests verify the correct operation of individual modules within an application, integration tests validate the cooperation of submodules with one another, and performance tests assess the application’s behavior under high loads. All this can be carried out in an automated mode by ML, including loading tests with various user emulators. This approach frees up human tester time for more complex scenarios.</li>
  <li>Automating Test Setup: Routine activities like creating a test environment and generating test data are easily automated with machine learning.</li>
  <li>High-Value and Business-Critical Tests: Automation of critical tests guarantees regular and frequent launch. This will help to eliminate the risk of regression and guarantee the stability of the fundamental functionality.</li>
  <li>Repetitive and Predictable Tests: Machine learning is ideal for automating tests that are frequently executed, have a clear pattern, and its execution is focused on a well-defined function.</li>
  <li>Tests Impossible to Perform Manually: Machine learning can automate complex test scenarios that are difficult to implement or impossible manually.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="future-directions-of-machine-learning-in-gray-box-testing">Future Directions of Machine Learning in Gray Box Testing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>AI-powered In-Production Testing: The future promises powered testing that includes analyzing the live production systems. With in-production testing, developers access real-time data insights into how their code is performing and any arising issues. In other words, developers will have the ability to detect problems before users experience their effects.</li>
  <li>Autonomous Testing: Some future models of machine learning may produce an AI that rarely requires human intervention in its testing processes. Shortly, we can imagine a fully automated process in which AI generates, executes, and analyzes the results of the given test cases.</li>
  <li>Machine Learning for User Behavior Monitoring: Machine learning can actively monitor how users interact with applications and alert for gaps in testing. By analyzing user behavior patterns and identifying unexpected interactions, machine learning can pinpoint areas where additional testing might be necessary. This helps ensure to cope up with the <a href="https://www.esparkinfo.com/blog/software-testing-trends.html">software testing trends</a> and caters to real-world user behavior and minimizes the risk of usability issues.</li>
  <li>Continuous Testing: The future of software testing involves, but is not limited to, continuous testing, cloud-based lab solutions, and integration with existing processes. Continuous testing defines the future of an ideal software development life cycle, where code changes are tested and verified continuously. To achieve such an ideal, the teams need to be exposed to open access to the test lab, and the right tools to run and perform tests more efficiently. For instance, machine learning can also be employed in testing to monitor and provide real-time feedback when code changes are deployed.</li>
  <li>Cloud-based Lab Solutions: Cloud-based lab solutions, provide a scalable and cost-effective ideal way to apply continuous testing. This is achievable since the labs run on the powerful cloud, making the test environments and resources readily available; as such, many organizations can easily embrace machine learning-powered gray box testing. </li>
  <li>Integration with Existing Processes: Finally, the future also involves the integration of <a href="https://www.thesmartscanner.com/blog/how-ai-and-machine-learning-are-revolutionizing-web-security">machine learning and AI</a> into the existing software testing process. The process would not only augment the existing process but also the human expertise on these platforms. The overall result will be a more efficient and comprehensive testing process.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, machine learning provides a robust toolset for automating and improving gray box testing. The early investment costs, lack of qualified expertise, and requiring effort to support are only a few of the many hurdles to overcome. However, in terms of productivity, accuracy, and early identification of bugs, the potential advantages are well worth it. </p>

<p>Advances in the process and an increasingly knowledgeable talent will move us closer to the future in how we think about gray box testing.

It is a plain text file that is placed in the root directory of a website and is used to communicate with search engine crawlers, telling them which pages or sections of a site should or should not be indexed.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<p>Use the <a href="/tools/robotstxt">online robots.txt validator</a> to make sure your robots.txt is well formatted and has no security risk.</p>

<section class="shadow-2 bg-near-white pa4 mv5  f4 flex justify-between items-center">
 <span>Use free online robots.txt validator to check your robots.txt</span>
 <a href="/tools/robotstxt/" class="f5 br3 ph3 pv2 dib white ba bw1 dark-green mh1 mb0">Try it Now!</a>
</section>

<p>The robots.txt file is a set of instructions that tell web crawlers which parts of a website they are allowed to access. These web crawlers are automated programs that scan websites to gather information about the pages and content on a site. While these crawlers can help index a website and make it more visible in search engine results, they can also consume a lot of server resources and bandwidth if they are not properly managed. Not every robot out there is good. That’s why having a properly written robots.txt file is very important.</p>

<p>The structure of a robots.txt file is relatively simple but it is also hard to debug and make sure it’s working as expected. But with our new online <a href="/tools/robotstxt">tool</a> for validating robots.txt it’s easy to create one.</p>

<p>You can simply copy and paste your robots.txt contents into this tool and check possible errors. Then you can easily fix the problems with recommendations provided for each issue.</p>

<h2 id="security-issues-in-robotstxt">Security Issues in Robots.txt</h2>
<p>There’s a misunderstanding that a robots.txt file can be used for protecting sensitive files on a website. That’s <a href="/blog/is-your-robots-txt-file-vulnerable-here-s-how-to-check-and-secure-it">why many websites disclose valuable information</a> to hackers. One benefit of our online <a href="/tools/robotstxt">robots.txt checker</a> is that it can also check for security-related problems in robots.txt.</p>

<p>The online robots.txt validator can detect up to 19 problems. In the following, we explain some common security vulnerabilities that can be found in a robots.txt file.</p>

<h2 id="file-disclosure-in-disallow">File Disclosure in Disallow</h2>
<p>It happens when you add a <code>disallow</code> record with a full file path.
The robots.txt is a voluntary mechanism. It’s not sufficient to guarantee some robots will not visit restricted URLs. In fact, malicious users can use robots.txt to find out the resources you are trying to hide; like a <a href="/vulnerabilities/unreferenced-login-page-found">login page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-fix">How to Fix</h3>
<p>You should not use the disallow rule for protecting files. Following are some alternatives:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Use strong authentication</strong>: For sensitive resources on your website you must use strong authentication and access control mechanisms.</li>
  <li><strong>You don’t need to disallow at all</strong>: If the file in the <code>disallow</code> rule is not linked to your website, you don’t need a disallow for it.</li>
  <li><strong>Use <code>noindex</code> meta tag</strong>: If you only want to prevent search engines from indexing your URL, you can use the <code>noindex</code> ruleset. <code>noindex</code> is a rule set with either a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag or HTTP response header and is used to prevent indexing content by search engines that support the <code>noindex</code> rule, such as Google.</li>
  <li><strong>Use pattern</strong>: Instead of revealing the full path, use patterns in the disallow rule. for example, use <code>disallow: /*.php</code> to exclude all php file</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="directory-disclosure-in-disallow">Directory Disclosure in Disallow</h2>
<p>Revealing directories like <code>/admin/</code> in the disallow rule gives hackers a clue to start digging in that directory.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-prevent">How to Prevent</h3>
<p>In addition to the above recommendations, you should make sure <a href="/vulnerability-list/directory-listing">directory listing</a> is disabled on your website.</p>

<h2 id="possible-path-disclosure-in-allow">Possible Path Disclosure in Allow</h2>
<p>By revealing URLs in the <code>allow</code> rule, you <a href="/vulnerability-list/sensitive-unreferenced-resource-found">disclose resources to malicious users</a>. You must make sure these URLs are not sensitive.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-avoid">How to Avoid</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you’re not revealing any sensitive resources.</li>
  <li>Make sure revealed folders do not display a directory listing.</li>

In this article, we will explore how to securely work with files in your application.</p>

<p>Let’s review common vulnerabilities and mitigations when working file files.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>File Inclusions and Path Traversal vulnerabilities are the results of insecure accessing files</li>
  <li>Avoid accessing file paths that are built with user-provided input</li>
  <li>If you must use inputs from users in file paths, use a strict whitelist for allowed user inputs and reject non-compliant inputs</li>
  <li>Use libraries to detect if the file you’re going to access is in the intended directory (e.g. <code>realpath()</code> in PHP and NodeJs)</li>
  <li>When creating files (e.g. file uploads) set a reasonable file size limit</li>
  <li>When writing user-provided content, make sure the content type is what you expect</li>
  <li>When creating files, make sure they don’t have execution permission</li>
  <li>When creating files, make sure they’re not publicly accessible</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="file-inclusion-vulnerability">File Inclusion Vulnerability</h2>
<p>File inclusion vulnerability is a type of web vulnerability that occurs when an application allows a user to include a file in the output of a web page without properly validating or sanitizing the user input.</p>

<p>There are two types of file inclusion vulnerabilities: <em>Local File Inclusion (LFI)</em> and <em>Remote File Inclusion (RFI)</em>.</p>

<p>LFI occurs when an attacker can include a file from the local file system of the server. This can allow the attacker to view sensitive files or execute arbitrary code on the server.</p>

<p>RFI occurs when an attacker can include a file from a remote server. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or steal sensitive information.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following vulnerable PHP code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-PHP">$module = $_GET['module'];
include $module;
</code></pre>

<p>This code retrieves a value from the URL query string using the <code>$_GET</code> superglobal, specifically the “module” parameter. The retrieved value is then used as the file path to include a PHP file using the <code>include</code> statement. This means that the contents of the specified file will be included in the current script at the point where the <code>include</code> statement appears.</p>

<p>However, this code can be potentially dangerous to both LFI and RFI.</p>

<p>In the above PHP code example, a user can pass any file name or URL as the <code>module</code> parameter. For instance, an attacker can host a PHP script on their server and pass its URL, like <code>http://attackerhost/phpscript.txt</code>, in the module parameter and execute arbitrary commands on the target system.</p>

<p>In PHP, for example, file inclusion vulnerabilities are often caused by the use of the <code>include</code> or <code>require</code> functions without proper input validation. Similarly, in JSP, file inclusion vulnerabilities can occur when the <code>include</code> or <code>jsp:include</code> tags are used without proper input validation. Using <code>Server.Execute</code> or <code>Server.Transfer</code> in ASP also can create file inclusion vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 id="local-file-download">Local File Download</h2>
<p>Suppose an application has a file download functionality that allows users to download a file from the server. The application takes a file name as a parameter and returns the file contents to the user. If the application does not validate the file name parameter and allows users to download any file on the server, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by passing a sensitive file name as the parameter. This is called <em>Local File Download</em> or <em>Local File Disclosure</em> vulnerability.</p>

<p>In our example, if the user passes <code>/etc/passwd</code> as a module parameter, the content of <code>passwd</code> file is displayed to the user.</p>

<p>Local file download is a very common vulnerability and can be found in any programming language.</p>

<h3 id="prevent-file-inclusion-vulnerabilities">Prevent File Inclusion Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>Follow below best practices to mitigate File Inclusion vulnerabilities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do not include or open files that are built using user-provided data</li>
  <li>If you must use inputs from users in file paths, use a strict whitelist for allowed user inputs and reject non-compliant inputs</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="path-traversal-vulnerability">Path Traversal Vulnerability</h2>
<p><em>Path traversal</em> vulnerability, also known as <em>directory traversal</em> vulnerability, is another web security vulnerability that allows attackers to access files outside of the intended directory. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive files, such as configuration files, password files, and even source code files.  </p>

<p>This vulnerability occurs when you create file paths using invalidated user input. This allows the attacker to navigate to directories and files using the <code>../</code> character sequences. The <code>../</code> character sequences refer to the parent directory on file systems.</p>

<p>Consider below revised version of our vulnerable PHP code.</p>

<pre><code class="language-PHP">$module = $_GET['module'];
include './' . $module;
</code></pre>

<p>By prefixing the module variable with <code>./</code> character sequences, we’re limiting file inclusion to the current directory only. So users cannot pass absolute file names like <code>/etc/passwd</code> or URLs that will eliminate RFI. But the user can enter <code>../../../../../../../etc/passwd</code> as module parameter value and the final file path would resolve to <code>/etc/passwd</code>. This will reveal the contents of the passwd file.</p>

<p>The Path traversal vulnerability can occur in any programming language and also in Windows operating systems.</p>

<h3 id="prevent-path-traversal-vulnerability">Prevent Path Traversal Vulnerability</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Do not include or open files that are built using user-provided data</li>
  <li>If you must use inputs from users in file paths, use a strict whitelist for allowed user inputs and reject non-compliant inputs</li>
  <li>Use libraries to detect if the file you’re going to access is in the intended directory (e.g. <code>realpath()</code> in PHP and NodeJs)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="file-upload-vulnerability">File Upload Vulnerability</h2>
<p>When it comes to uploading files, security is paramount. Unfortunately, there is a severe vulnerability called <em>arbitrary file upload</em> that can compromise your data. This vulnerability allows users to upload any type of file, including scripts like PHP, Python, or ASP code, which can execute any command on your server.</p>

<p>In addition to arbitrary file upload, insecure file upload functionality can also introduce other vulnerabilities like <em>Denial of Service (DoS)</em> attacks. For example, if you don’t set a limit on the file size that can be uploaded, an attacker could upload an excessively large file and potentially cause a DoS attack or consume excessive server resources.</p>

<p>Furthermore, insecure file uploads can allow attackers to override sensitive files using path traversal or upload malware to your server.</p>

<h3 id="prevent-insecure-file-uploads">Prevent Insecure File Uploads</h3>
<p>To prevent file upload vulnerabilities from happening, implement the following measures:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set a reasonable file size limit and validate that uploaded files are within that limit.</li>
  <li>Validate that uploaded files are of the expected file type and reject any files that are not.</li>
  <li>Use randomly generated file names for storing uploaded files. If you have to use user-provided filenames, use a white list filter for accepted file names and reject other file names.</li>
  <li>Use reputable anti-virus or malware detection software to scan uploaded files before they are processed or stored on your server.</li>
  <li>Make sure uploaded files do not have execution permission.</li>
  <li>Make sure only required users have access to the uploaded files.</li>

Let’s see if you’re using them right.</p>

<p>Random numbers play a critical role in web application security. They are used in session identifiers, passwords, cryptographic keys, and more. However, if not implemented securely, they can lead to vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Most random generators are not really random. They use math that looks random</li>
  <li>Do not use <code>Math.random()</code> in JavaScript or <code>random</code> in Python</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API"><code>Web Crypto API</code></a> in JavaScript, <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html"><code>crypto</code></a> module in NodeJs, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html"><code>secrets</code></a> in python</li>
  <li>Do not try to implement your own random generation algorithm</li>
  <li>Incorrect usage of secure random numbers can make your application vulnerable</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-random-functions-work">How Random Functions work</h2>
<p>There are two main types of Random Number Generators (RNGs): pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) and true random number generators (TRNGs).</p>

<h3 id="pseudo-random-number-generators-prngs">Pseudo-random Number Generators (PRNGs)</h3>
<p>PRNGs are the most commonly used type of RNGs. They work by using an algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers that appear to be random. The algorithm takes an initial value as input and produces a series of numbers based on it.</p>

<p>The common algorithms used in PRNGs are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister">Mersenne-Twister</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator (LCG)</a>.</p>

<p>These algorithms get an initial number called <code>seed</code>. They change it by adding previous random number, shifting, and doing XOR operators to generate the output. The output looks like a random number though it’s just an output of a formula.</p>

<p>If you keep executing any PRNG, it will eventually generate the same numbers over and over. Any PRNG has a fixed length of numbers that can generate before starting over.</p>

<h3 id="true-random-number-generators-trngs">True Random Number Generators (TRNGs)</h3>
<p>TRNGs generate truly random numbers based on physical processes that are inherently random. These processes include atmospheric noise, radioactive decay, and thermal noise. TRNGs measure the physical process and convert it into a random number.</p>

<h2 id="random-function-vulnerabilities">Random Function Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The seed and random number generation algorithm both can have weaknesses.</p>

<h3 id="prediction">Prediction</h3>
<p>You can say predictability is the main vulnerability of weak random number generators. PRNGs are inherently predictable as they are based on a mathematical formula. So if you know the seed and last random number, you can predict the next random number. This can lead to severe vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>For example, consider a forget password functionality that words based on a random token. If the token can be predicted, an attacker can reset the password of any user.</p>

<h3 id="collision">Collision</h3>
<p>Besides the predictability, Some random generators that have low quality produce duplicate values very often. This can increase the risk of collision.</p>

<p>Consider an application that generates random session tokens for its users. The chances of producing duplicate session tokens are related to two factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Size of random space (length of session token)</li>
  <li>Quality of the random selection</li>
</ul>

<p>Short-length tokens will have a higher chance of collisions. And bad random generator does not generate all possible values. This can lead to vulnerabilities where a user can see another user’s data.</p>

<h3 id="seed-leakage-or-manipulation">Seed Leakage or Manipulation</h3>
<p>Another vulnerability related to random number generators is choosing a weak seed. PRNG always generates the same sequence of numbers with the same initial seed value. If an attacker can find the used seed or manipulate it, he can easily generate same random numbers.</p>

<p>In pratice, hackers use different methods to predict the next random number. Some methods may involve statistical analysis, while others may involve reverse-engineering the generator’s algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-secure-random-numbers">How to Use Secure Random Numbers</h2>
<p>Using cryptographically secure random number generation algorithms is the key to securely producing random numbers. These algorithms generate random numbers that are unpredictable and cannot be easily guessed by attackers. The output of these algorithms is resistant to brute-force attacks, and it’s statistically robust.
You should not try to implement your own one unless you know what you are doing. Instead, always use known to be secure random libraries.</p>

<p>Let’s see a few examples of using secure random libraries in different programming languages.</p>

<h3 id="javascript">Javascript</h3>
<p>The <code>Math.random()</code> function is not suitable for cryptographic purposes, as it is not truly random and can be predicted or manipulated by an attacker.</p>

<p>To generate a secure random number in JavaScript, you can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API"><code>Web Crypto API</code></a>. The <code>Crypto.getRandomValues()</code> method lets you get cryptographically strong random values. Here is an example code that generates a secure random number:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Javascript">function generateRandomNumber() {  
  const array = new Uint32Array(1); // Create a 32-bit unsigned integer array  
  window.crypto.getRandomValues(array); // Fill the array with random values  
  return array[0]; // Return the first element of the array as the random number  
}  
 
console.log(generateRandomNumber()); // Output a random number between 0 and 4294967295
</code></pre>
<h3 id="nodejs">NodeJS</h3>
<p>In NodeJS, the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html"><code>crypto</code></a> module can be used to generate cryptographically secure random numbers. The following code sample illustrates the use of crypto module in generating a random number:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Javascript">const crypto = require('crypto');  
 
function generateRandomNumber() {  
  const randomBytes = crypto.randomBytes(4); // Generate 4 random bytes  
  const hexValue = randomBytes.toString('hex'); // Convert the bytes to a hex string  
  const intValue = parseInt(hexValue, 16); // Convert the hex string to an integer  
  return intValue;  
}  
 
console.log(generateRandomNumber()); // Output a random number between 0 and 4294967295
</code></pre>

<h3 id="python">Python</h3>
<p>In Python, the <code>random</code> module can be used to generate random numbers. However, it is not cryptographically secure. Instead, you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html"><code>secrets</code></a> module to generate cryptographically secure random numbers. The following code sample illustrates the use of secrets module in generating a random number:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Python">import secrets  
 
def generate_random_number():  
    random_number = secrets.randbits(32) # Generate a 32-bit random number  
    return random_number  
 
print(generate_random_number()) # Output a random number between 0 and 4294967295
</code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Random numbers in computers are mathematical formulas and predictable. Not every random number generator is suitable for cryptography and security usage. Random numbers are just one element in security system design and implementation. There are many other things like seed generation, key management, and overall security system design that are extremely important and hard to get right.

However, what will never become obsolete are <a href="https://www.youngwonks.com/blog/Basic-Guidelines-for-Internet-Security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online safety</a> and web security.</p>

<p>We all know that the internet is home to a vast amount of data and information, making it a prime target for cyberattacks. Just look at the stats: in 2022, there was a whopping <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2023/01/05/38-increase-in-2022-global-cyberattacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">38% increase in global attacks</a> compared to 2021. To make matters worse, the average overall cost of data breaches in 2022 was <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$4.35 million</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, advancements in AI and machine learning technologies are revolutionizing <a href="https://www.thesmartscanner.com/blog/3-reasons-why-any-website-security-is-important">web security</a>. These solutions are being used to detect and prevent cyber threats by analyzing patterns in user behavior and identifying anomalies that could be potential security breaches.</p>

<p>By integrating these technologies, you can keep your websites and applications safe from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.</p>

<p>Here are some ways in which AI and machine learning are transforming web security:</p>

<h2 id="threat-detection-and-prevention">Threat Detection and Prevention</h2>
<p>Through <a href="https://www.vanta.com/resources/risk-assessment-101-working-backwards-from-the-controls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">risk assessment</a> and vulnerability management, AI and machine learning can help detect and prevent cyber attacks in real time. They analyze millions upon millions of lines of code and pieces of data to look for patterns and anomalies in user behavior and use this information to intercept security breaches before they happen.</p>

<p>For example, AI-powered security solutions can monitor network traffic to identify unusual activity that could indicate a cyberattack. By pinpointing and flagging potential threats in real time, security teams can take immediate action to mitigate the risks and safeguard everything from their <a href="https://andela.com/insights/key-skills-to-look-out-for-when-hiring-angular-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">light web applications</a> to content-heavy websites.</p>

<h2 id="malware-detection">Malware Detection</h2>
<p>Malware is a common threat that can infect a website or application, leading to data breaches and other security risks. AI and machine learning can help detect malware by analyzing patterns in the code and behavior of applications.</p>

<p>For instance, machine learning algorithms can analyze the code of an application to identify malicious code that may have been inserted by an attacker. These algorithms can also identify patterns of behavior that are consistent with malware, such as attempts to access sensitive data or make unauthorized changes to the system.</p>

<h2 id="user-authentication">User Authentication</h2>
<p>Another solution that AI and machine learning can put forward is improved user authentication, which is a critical aspect of web security. By analyzing patterns in user behavior, these technologies can identify fraudulent login attempts and other suspicious activity.</p>

<p>Take this, for instance: you can employ machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior, such as the time of day they typically access the system, the device they use, and the location from which they access the system. These algorithms can then use this data to identify anomalies that could indicate a fraudulent login attempt and prompt additional authentication steps, such as multi-factor authentication.</p>

<h2 id="fraud-detection">Fraud Detection</h2>
<p>Fraud is a significant problem for websites and applications that process financial transactions. Fortunately, you can use AI and machine learning to detect fraud by analyzing patterns in user behavior and identifying anomalies that could indicate fraudulent activity.</p>

<p>For instance, machine learning algorithms can analyze data from financial transactions to find patterns that are consistent with fraud, such as unusually large transactions or purchases from unfamiliar locations. By detecting and flagging potential fraud activity, these algorithms can help prevent huge financial losses and protect sensitive data from ending up in the wrong hands.</p>

<h2 id="predictive-analysis">Predictive Analysis</h2>
<p>AI and machine learning can also be used to predict potential security risks and prevent them before they even happen. These technologies can analyze your historical data to identify patterns and trends that may indicate potential security breaches.</p>

<p>For example, predictive analytics algorithms can analyze data from previous security breaches to identify common patterns and trends. Once they’ve identified these patterns, security professionals can take over and set up proactive measures to prevent similar attacks from happening again in the future.</p>

<h2 id="optimized-data-centers">Optimized Data Centers</h2>
<p>AI and machine learning can also optimize and monitor numerous essential data center processes, including backup power, cooling filters, power consumption, internal temperatures, and bandwidth usage. AI and machine learning’s calculative powers and continuous monitoring capabilities offer insights into what values might improve the efficiency and security of hardware and infrastructure.</p>

<p>AI and machine learning can also lower the cost of hardware maintenance by alerting you when equipment needs to be fixed. These alerts provide you with the opportunity to repair your equipment before it suffers more serious damage.</p>

<h2 id="artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-for-safer-websites-and-applications">Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Safer Websites and Applications</h2>
<p>As the threat of cyberattacks grows, AI and machine learning technologies will continue to transform web security by enabling security professionals and developers to detect and prevent cyber threats in real time, improve user authentication, and predict potential security risks, among other things.</p>

<p>Sooner rather than later, these technologies will become increasingly important in keeping websites and applications safe and secure against cyberattacks. That’s why it’s so important for you to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in AI and machine learning for web security.</p>

According to <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/javascript_library">w3techs</a>, more than 80% of websites use at least one JavaScript library. So for penetration testing you should execute and run JavaScripts on web pages to find all functionalities and attack vectors like bakcned APIs.</p>

<p>SmartScanner already has an javascript evaluation engine for running JavaScripts. In version 1.16 and 1.17 we completed the support for testing REST APIs. We added capability of identifying and testing requests sent with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a> APIs with any HTTP methods. These APIs are backbone of any AJAX libraries like jQuery and axios.</p>

<p>All these new features and enhancements combined with our JavaScript evaluation engine made SmartScanner capable of automated vulnerability finding in any web application. No matter what technology your website is using; a Jamstack application, a single page application (SPA) or a modern reactive application built with ReactJS, Angular, Vue or Svelte. Just enter the URL, SmartScanner automatically tests and finds security vulnerablilities!</p>

<p>We also made huge changes in our application architecture that resulted in many improvements like, speed and memory optimizations. But a few bugs could find the chance to escape behind these changes! In version 1.18, we focused on polishing features and fixing broken things.</p>

<p>Now, we are excited to announce release of SmartScanner version 1.18, smarter and sharper than ever.</p>

<p>And that’s not all! <a href="/vulnerability-list/insecure-inline-frame">Insecure Inline Frame</a>, <a href="/vulnerability-list/user-controllable-url">User Controllable URL</a> and <a href="/vulnerability-list/unicode-transformation-issue">Unicode Transformation Issue</a> are new tests we’ve added with many XSS and SQLI improvements in version 1.18.

This article is going to change your mind.</p>

<h2 id="hacked-website-can-affect-your-audience">Hacked website can affect your audience</h2>

<p>Security is critical as long as you have any visitor on your website (actually, security is vital even if you don’t have any visitor at all, you’ll see!).</p>

<p>Either recruiters on your personal project portfolio website or customers on your online shopping platform, it doesn’t matter who you are targeting on your website. Any of your website visitors can be targeted by hackers as well if you don’t make your website secure.</p>

<p>Your website can have many vulnerabilities, and any of them would be sufficient for hackers to compromise your website to use it against your visitors. Security vulnerabilities like <a href="/vulnerability-list/cross-site-scripting">XSS</a>, <a href="/vulnerability-list/sql-injection">SQLI</a> or <a href="/vulnerability-list/local-file-inclusion">File Inclusions</a> allow hackers to take control over what your visitors see on your website. These vulnerabilities can exist on any page, or they might be in your web server’s configurations or even in an outdated WordPress plugin.</p>

<h3 id="why-should-hackers-hack-my-website">Why should hackers hack my website?</h3>

<p>Hackers take over your website to do any of below malicious tasks.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/over-16500-sites-hacked-to-distribute.html">Distributing malwares</a></li>
  <li>Stealing your customers data</li>
  <li>Making your web server a zombie and using it in DDOS attacks against other targets</li>
  <li>Mining cryptocurrencies using your web server or your visitor’s CPU power</li>
  <li>Using your servers for running software like proxy or spammers.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see that even if no one visits your website, security is still essential because hackers can abuse your web server against inocent targets. Or, you might receive a costly bill from your hosting service because a hacker is using too much CPU power on your server to mine cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h2 id="reputation-loss">Reputation loss</h2>

<p>You run a website for a reason. It could be revenue, finding a job or being creative. A hacked website impacts your reputation. Bad reputations results in less visitors, less trust and less revenue or job interviews.</p>

<p>Besides, not having a secure website has negative SEO impact. Google and other search engines penalize websites without SSL Certificate. If your site has <a href="/vulnerability-list/no-https">no HTTPS</a> and your competition does, Google punishes your websites, and your competitor website come up higher on Google search results than you are. Google Chrome also displays a red “Not secure” note in address bar for sites without SSL.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/no-https-chrome.jpg" width="768" height="351" alt="Google Chrome displaying alert for non-https sites" loading="lazy" style="aspect-ratio: attr(width) / attr(height); height:auto;" /></p>

<p>Hacked website is a thread to visitors, so it’s no surprise to see that <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/search-spam-report-2017/">Google removes hacked website from search results</a>.</p>

<p>When your website gets hacked, it can be added to specific black-lists like Google Safe Browsing list. The Safe Browsing lists—also referred to as threat lists or simply lists—are Google’s constantly updated lists of unsafe web resources. Many applications like browsers use these lists to prevent users from accessing a hacked website.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/deceptive-site-ahead.png" width="768" height="477" alt="Google Chrome warning user about deceptive site" loading="lazy" style="aspect-ratio: attr(width) / attr(height); height:auto;" /></p>

<p>If your visitors get warned about security of your website, the chances are extremely low that they will buy on your website, invite you to interview or visit your site anyhow.</p>

<h2 id="prevention-is-better-than-cure">Prevention is better than cure</h2>

<p>OK, you got hacked! Now you have to clean up your website, restore your backup, remove your website from black-lists and inform your users. You lost your customers and revenue untill you’ve rebuilt the trust and reputation. That’s a enormous task to recover from a security incident, and it will cost you time and money.</p>

<p>In most cases recovery and fixing a hacked website is a complex task that requires experts to do it manually, and of course it will not be for free.</p>

<h2 id="how-vulnerable-is-your-website">How vulnerable is your website?</h2>

<p>Hackers look for low hanging fruits. They look for high risk vulnerabilities in many websites (because any website can be usefull). Read more about hacker methods on <a href="/blog/how-do-hackers-hack">how hackers hack</a> article.</p>

<p>Good news is you can be like hackers. You can find holes in your website before hackers find them.</p>

<p>Testing security of your website is easy. There are dozen of web security testing tools out there you can use for free. <a href="https://www.arachni-scanner.com/">Arachni</a> and <a href="https://w3af.org/">w3af</a> are famous open source security scanners you can use.</p>
