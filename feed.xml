From expanded test capabilities to important bug fixes, this update reflects our continued focus on precision, usability, and performance.</p>

<p>Let’s walk through what’s new in this release.</p>

<h2 id="-new-features">🔍 New Features</h2>

<h3 id="sensitive-data-disclosure-detection">Sensitive Data Disclosure Detection</h3>

<p>SmartScanner 2.2 introduces a powerful new test for detecting <a href="/vulnerability-list/sensitive-data-disclosure">Sensitive Data Disclosure</a>. This helps uncover exposed information such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>API keys and access tokens</li>
  <li>Credentials in code or comments</li>
</ul>

<p>This addition strengthens your ability to prevent accidental data leaks that could otherwise become an entry point for attackers.</p>

<h3 id="powered-by-trusted-patterns">Powered by Trusted Patterns</h3>

<p>Our new <strong>Sensitive Data Disclosure test</strong> is built using detection patterns inspired by the excellent <a href="https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks">gitleaks</a> project. While the scanning logic is fully developed in-house, we’ve incorporated some of the same proven rulesets to enhance detection coverage for secrets, credentials, and other exposed data.</p>

<p>This allows us to deliver precise, high-confidence results while ensuring full integration into SmartScanner’s existing engine and reporting system.</p>

<h3 id="no-crawl-option-for-targeted-scans">No-Crawl Option for Targeted Scans</h3>

<p>Need to scan a predefined list of URLs without crawling? Now you can. SmartScanner 2.2 includes a <strong>no-crawl mode</strong> perfect for tight scope assessments or automation workflows where crawl behavior isn’t needed. Just provide a list of URLs, and we’ll take it from there without crawling beyond them.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/using-no-crawl-option.gif" width="525" height="367" alt="Scanning target list with no-crawl option" loading="lazy" class="mx-auto" style="aspect-ratio: attr(width) / attr(height); height:auto;" /></p>

<h3 id="javascript-file-scanning">JavaScript File Scanning</h3>

<p>You can now directly scan standalone JavaScript (<code>.js</code>) files. This allows you to inspect public scripts for issues such as insecure APIs, exposed secrets, or obfuscated malicious code, giving you broader coverage for both client-side and back-end assets.</p>

<h2 id="-smarter-and-smoother-experience">🧠 Smarter and Smoother Experience</h2>

<h3 id="improved-manual-login-workflow">Improved Manual Login Workflow</h3>

<p>We’ve refined the manual login process: the browser window now <strong>auto-fills the target URL</strong> when launched, saving time and making the process more intuitive, especially helpful when working with authentication-heavy web apps.</p>

<h2 id="-detection-rule-updates">🔄 Detection Rule Updates</h2>

<p>We’ve updated several core vulnerability checks to reflect the latest threat intelligence and software versions. These enhancements improve detection accuracy for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/vulnerability-list/vulnerable-apache-version">Vulnerable Apache Versions</a></li>
  <li><a href="/vulnerability-list/vulnerable-tomcat-version">Vulnerable Tomcat Versions</a></li>
  <li><a href="/vulnerability-list/vulnerable-php-version">Vulnerable PHP Versions</a></li>
  <li><a href="/vulnerability-list/vulnerable-openssl-version">Vulnerable OpenSSL Versions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Keeping these rules current ensures that SmartScanner stays ahead of emerging threats.</p>

<h2 id="-bug-fixes">🛠 Bug Fixes</h2>

<p>We also resolved a couple of important issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Crash during scan:</strong> Fixed a rare but disruptive crash that could occur mid-scan.</li>
  <li><strong>Report truncation issue:</strong> Fixed a bug where HTTP responses in reports were improperly truncated, causing proof-of-concept payloads to be partially hidden.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>SmartScanner 2.2 is another step forward in making web vulnerability scanning more accurate, efficient, and Smarter. Whether you’re performing ad hoc security reviews, scanning during deployments, or using SmartScanner manually, this release gives you more precision and control over how scans are executed and reported.</p>

<p><strong>Server Version Disclosure</strong> occurs when a web server exposes its software name and version number in the <code>Server</code> HTTP response header. This header may also reveal the operating system or other internal components used by the server.</p>

<p>Exposing this information helps attackers identify known vulnerabilities specific to the disclosed versions, making it easier to launch targeted attacks.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-detect-server-version-disclosure">How to Detect Server Version Disclosure</h2>

<p>Detecting server version disclosure is simple and passive. The <code>Server</code> header is present in most HTTP responses. You can view it using browser developer tools or any HTTP client, such as <code>curl</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ curl -I example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK  
Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:25:28 GMT  
Server: Apache/2.4.50 (Debian)  
Content-Type: text/html  
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, the server reveals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web server software: <strong>Apache</strong></li>
  <li>Version: <strong>2.4.50</strong></li>
  <li>Operating system: <strong>Debian</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Note: The <code>Server</code> header might be absent or obfuscated based on server settings. For reliable detection, use an automated scanner like <a href="/download"><strong>SmartScanner</strong></a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-attackers-exploit-server-version-disclosure">How Attackers Exploit Server Version Disclosure</h2>

<p>While the <code>Server</code> header itself isn’t a direct vulnerability, it enables attackers to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify the exact server version</li>
  <li>Search for related public exploits on platforms like <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE Details</a> or Exploit-DB</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> If <code>Server: Apache/2.4.50</code> is exposed, searching reveals <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41773" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2021-41773</a>, a high-severity RCE vulnerability. Public exploits for it exist, making exploitation trivial.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Headers can be faked, but most often they reveal accurate information unless explicitly configured otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-server-version-disclosure">How to Prevent Server Version Disclosure</h2>

<p>Most web servers allow you to disable or customize the <code>Server</code> header. Here are guides for popular platforms:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/vulnerability-list/apache-version-disclosure">Hide Apache Server Version</a></li>
  <li><a href="/vulnerability-list/nginx-version-disclosure">Hide Nginx Server Version</a></li>
  <li><a href="/vulnerability-list/server-version-disclosure/#fix-server-version-disclosure-in-tomcat">Hide Tomcat Server Version</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Obscuring version info does <strong>not fix</strong> the underlying vulnerabilities. Always keep your software updated to the latest secure versions.</p>

This guide delves into practical strategies for managing security incidents in line with ISO 27001, showcasing how organizations can fortify their defenses and maintain compliance.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-security-incidents">Understanding Security Incidents</h2>

<p>A security incident can disrupt operations, expose sensitive data, or even compromise the integrity of business processes. From malware attacks to insider threats, each incident demands a specific approach, tailored to both mitigate immediate risks and prevent future occurrences.</p>

<h2 id="incident-management-the-iso-27001-approach">Incident Management: The ISO 27001 Approach</h2>

<h3 id="preparation">Preparation</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Policy and Procedures</strong>: Develop an incident management policy aligned with ISO 27001 incident management solutions. This policy should detail incident classification, response team roles, and escalation procedures.  </li>
  <li><strong>Training</strong>: Equip your team with the knowledge to detect, respond to, and report incidents. Training should cover ISO 27001 <a href="https://feelagile.com/en/pourquoi-la-certification-iso-27001-va-devenir-obligatoire/">certification</a> requirements to ensure staff actions support compliance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="detection-and-reporting">Detection and Reporting</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Monitoring Tools</strong>: Leverage technology to detect incidents early. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems can be instrumental here.  </li>
  <li><strong>Incident Logging</strong>: Maintain a log of all incidents, including minor ones, to track patterns and improve response strategies.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="response">Response</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Containment</strong>: Act swiftly to isolate affected systems or networks. This might involve disconnecting devices or rerouting traffic.  </li>
  <li><strong>Eradication</strong>: Identify and eliminate the root cause of the incident. This could mean patching vulnerabilities, deleting malicious software, or changing compromised credentials.  </li>
  <li><strong>Recovery</strong>: Use secure, tested backups to restore services, ensuring no residual threats remain.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="post-incident-activities">Post-Incident Activities</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Dissect the incident to understand its nature, cause, and impact. This step is crucial for compliance documentation.  </li>
  <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Keep detailed records of each phase of the incident for audit purposes and to inform future policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-importance-of-a-cybersecurity-culture-in-incident-management">The Importance of a Cybersecurity Culture in Incident Management</h2>

<p>Beyond technical measures and compliance checklists, fostering a strong cybersecurity culture within an organization is essential for effective incident management. Employees, regardless of their role, are often the first line of defense against cyber threats. However, without a culture that prioritizes security awareness and proactive engagement, even the most advanced security frameworks can fall short.</p>

<p>A security-conscious culture starts with executive leadership. When company leaders actively support and participate in cybersecurity initiatives, it sets a precedent for the entire organization. Regular training sessions tailored to different roles—ranging from IT specialists to customer service representatives—help ensure that every employee understands their responsibilities in identifying and reporting threats. Simulated phishing tests, real-world attack case studies, and cross-departmental security drills can reinforce best practices.</p>

<p>Additionally, a clear and open communication channel for reporting incidents without fear of blame is crucial. Employees must feel comfortable reporting suspicious activities, even if they turn out to be false alarms. Encouraging a mindset of “see something, say something” can prevent minor security lapses from escalating into full-blown breaches.</p>

<p>Organizations that embed cybersecurity into their daily operations—rather than treating it as an IT-exclusive function—can respond to incidents faster, mitigate risks more effectively, and maintain compliance with standards like ISO 27001. A complete guide to it should help you understand better. By prioritizing security culture, businesses not only strengthen their defenses but also enhance their ability to recover from incidents with minimal disruption.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Install SmartScanner:</strong><br />
<a href="/download">Download and Install SmartScanner</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Deploy Your App:</strong><br />
Fire up your Node.js server. Whether it’s an API, a NestJS module, or a NextJS project, make sure it’s accessible (for example, <code>http://localhost:3000</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Run SmartScanner:</strong><br />
Open SmartScanner, paste your app’s URL, and click “Scan.”<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> Use SmartScanner’s HTTP testing tab to simulate POST, PUT, or DELETE requests with custom headers and payloads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="real-world-examples-how-smartscanner-enhances-your-code">Real-World Examples: How SmartScanner Enhances Your Code</h2>

<h3 id="1-locking-down-your-express-api">1. Locking Down Your Express API</h3>

<p>APIs are the backbone of many apps, but they can be vulnerable if not secured properly. Here’s a friendly example with Express:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const express = require('express');
const helmet = require('helmet');

const app = express();

// Add Helmet to set secure HTTP headers
app.use(helmet());

// Vulnerable endpoint: echoes user input without sanitization (potential XSS)
app.get('/vulnerable', (req, res) =&gt; {
  const userInput = req.query.input || '';
  res.send(`User input: ${userInput}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () =&gt; {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
</code></pre>

<p>In this Express example, the <code>/vulnerable</code> route echoes a query parameter without sanitization, creating a simple <strong><a href="/vulnerability-list/cross-site-scripting">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</a></strong> vulnerability. SmartScanner can detect this issue along with other security gaps like missing headers or weak configurations.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="2-boosting-security-in-your-nestjs-app">2. Boosting Security in Your NestJS App</h3>

<p>NestJS gives you a structured way to build scalable apps, but you still need to watch out for security pitfalls. Consider this simple NestJS controller:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {
  @Get()
  findAll(): string {
    return 'This action returns all users';
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once deployed, running SmartScanner on your NestJS endpoint helps catch misconfigurations or overlooked vulnerabilities in your controllers and middleware.</p>

<h3 id="3-securing-your-nextjs-project">3. Securing Your NextJS Project</h3>

<p>NextJS is awesome for both server-side rendering and static sites, but it also mixes server and client code. Here’s a simple NextJS API route:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, secure world!' });
}
</code></pre>

<p>SmartScanner will scan this endpoint to ensure that your full-stack project is secure from both server-side and client-side vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 id="best-practices-for-nodejs-security">Best Practices for Node.js Security</h2>

<p>While SmartScanner is a great tool, here are some extra tips to help you keep your app secure:</p>
